## What is HX?

HX is a Deus Ex Overhaul mod that adds cooperative gameplay to the story mode, developed by Hanfling, a dev behind the Revision mod.

## Installing for Playing
<div class="tcalert">Note: It is recommended that you use a fresh game install for this, to avoid mistaking errors in setting up HX for just being mismatches with other mods.</div>

First, grab the files, download [HX core files](https://builds.hx.hanfling.de/).
Extract these files in to your games /System folder, which will be one of these;
```
C:\Deus Ex\System\
C:\GOG Games\Deus Ex\System\
C:\Program Files\DeusEx\System\
C:\Program Files (x86)\DeusEx\System\
C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex\System\
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex\System\
```


## Installing for Hosting
<div class="tcalert">
Firstly, make sure you check [here](../hosting/) if you're unsure of how to host. The rest of this guide will assume you know how to host basic servers at least, and will only tell you how to install HX.
This also assumes you've installed HX for Playing as seen above, as that is required to host it.
</div>

1.  If you want to use a serverstarter batch file, check out [here](https://deusexhq.github.io/hosting/#server-starter), follow the same instructions but change batch code to the following.

```HX.exe 01_NYC_UNATCOIsland ?Game=HX.HXGameInfo?CombatDifficulty=1?FriendlyFire=1.000000?Difficulty=0 -server```

2. To launch from the game, do like you usually would, in the server browser click Host, change settings as desired there.
