<strong>Summary</strong>: An SP mission that lets you stay with UNATCO a little longer, an option many people, like myself,
have missed while playing Deus Ex. This is not a simple 'shoot'em all'-type mission, the player has to proceed with care.
Stealth is actually important, though probably not 100% necessary if you know what you have to do. ;) Especially in the
main map the player is not forced to move around in a certain way. The level design provides many possible paths and different
outcomes, the order for completing the objectives is not important, you can even fail some of them.<br> 29 MB download,
a couple of hours playtime. Have fun. :)

<strong>Summary</strong>: "Removing the suck from Deus Ex." It's an odd slogan, but that's what Shifter does, what little
of it there is. In my opinion anyway. A little mod that started off as an effort to get the damn laser sight to turn on
automatically now includes additional augmentations, unique weapons, new game mechanics, bugfixes, restored game content,
and even a complete and working alt-fire option for almost every weapon. All of this, seamlessly integrated into the existing
game, capable of running simultaneously with almost any other Deus Ex mod. Play your favorite mod, then play it again, "Shifter-ized".<br>	BioMod is an extension of Y|yukichigai's excellent Shifter mod for Deus Ex. While I still think Shifter is a definite improvement
over the original game, I sometimes felt while playing it that it was too conservative for my tastes. Eventually I decided
to make my own mod which would contain some radical changes that might give some people pause, but would hopefully breathe
new life into the game for everyone else.<br> As the name suggests, BioMod is primarily concerned with Deus Ex's augmentations,
with the aim of making them more balanced, but also a lot easier to manage. Most augs are now automated, using energy only
when they're actually doing their jobs. Some augs that were less useful or that would be a pain to manage have been made
free or given extra abilities, while those that I thought were un-salvageable have been replaced with entirely new augs.
In addition to the augmentation system, BioMod also makes some general gameplay changes, such as the addition of pickpocketing,
an autosave feature, achievement-like challenges, and a Thief style ledge grabbing system.
