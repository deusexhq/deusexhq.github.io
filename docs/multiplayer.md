## Gametypes

### Standard Gametypes

<ul>
	<li>ATDM &mdash; Advanced Team Deathmatch</li>
	<li>BTDM &mdash; Basic Team Deathmatch</li>
	<li>CTDM &mdash; Custom Team Deathmatch</li>
	<li>DM &mdash; DeathMatch </li>
</ul>
<p>
	In truth, there are many game types in Deus Ex Multiplayer. These vary from the standard Deathmatch to the more creative
	DXAG. This guide will follow some of the most popularly played and appreciated gametypes created to this date.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Advanced Team Deathmatch (ATDM)</strong> <br /> This is one of the more played Deus Ex gametype. The tempo of an
	augged game is a lot faster than that of a 0-aug. With the use of such augs as Ballistic protection and speed aug, enemies
	become increasingly difficult to kill, demanding more and more skill to kill as the players develop better tactics at the
	game. <br /> This gametype does demand alot of will and patients. With the necessity to gain augs and skill points as you
	score points, survival is just as important as killing.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Basic Team Deathmatch (BTDM)</strong> <br /> This gametype is popular for featuring maxed-out skills as well as
	augs. This gametype will often either have full augs or a set limit with no possible way of increasing it. Unlike ATDM,
	patients is not a crucial factor of this mode. Although you may want to keep your death-ratio down, you do not have to
	fear losing your well-earned skill points and augs, as you will simply respawn with what you died with.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Zero-augs </strong> <br /> Exactly as it sounds. This gametype is frowned upon by some of the DeusEx community
	as not being a &quot;pure part&quot; of the game, as 0-Augs came after Augs. Many disputes and rivalrys have been created
	over this, each side fighting for what they believe is the best. Active members of DeusEx will be aware of these never-ending
	disputes. <br /> Skill-points are often at Maxed-out level. 0-Augs is somewhat slower than an augged game, as players don't
	have augs to fall back on, and fights are often quite short but frequent because of this.
</p>
### Created Gametypes
<p>
	<strong>TNAG</strong> <br /> This gametype is often featured on the servers &quot;Altfire,&quot; famous for their German
	clan, [FGS] The famously coded guns featured within this gametype are expertly created. Their main feature is called &quot;AltFire.&quot;
	Typing altfire with a gun out with perform an &quot;Alternate fire&quot;, as the name suggests. This can different from
	shooting a large projectile instead of a thin laser, from bouncing discs to exploding on impact ones. The mod overall is
	cleverly done and worth playing without a doubt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Deus Ex Arx Genus (DXAG)</strong> <br /> This gametype truely is revolutionary. Once spawned, it is the players
	choice to choose between 5 classes:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Engineer,</li>
	<li>Assassin,</li>
	<li>Sniper,</li>
	<li>Soldier,</li>
	<li>Medic. </li>
</ul>
<p>
	Each have different features, for example, the medic can heal others and the engineer can take over turrets and open multitool-locked
	doors. To successfully dominate a level, teamwork is essential. For example, to take the comm turret on Area51, an assassin
	must open the door with a lockpick, and an engineer must open the case containing the console. <br /> The mod is still
	in development, with new classes, updates and maps being created all the time.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Deus Ex StarGate (DXSG)</strong> <br /> Created by [A]Nobody himself. This small but cleverly made gametype. If
	you have ever seen Stargate on TV (It's hard not to of), then you will recognize the Goa'uld Ring-Transporters placed throughout
	the maps. Entering a code, such as 27, will activate the transporters. Stepping into these as they descend will teleport
	you in a flash of nicely created animation and sound to the specified destination. A server is often hosted as of late
	that features this gametype. Unique weapons are also placed within the maps for a more &quot;Stargate feel.&quot; These
	include the Neutron Bomb and Sclaw.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Jim Bowen's</strong> <br /> Once again, a cleverly created gametype that features many interesting and unusual
	weapons! Some of these include mine launchers, portable turrets, teleporting grenades, flashbangs and force rifles. A server
	hosting this is always a good laugh, and as-long as you&rsquo;re not one of those who complain about dying a lot from explosives,
	then you should be fine!
</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong> <br /> This is, sadly, a rarely played game type. I have only ever seen it hosted
	twice in my time of playing. The main reason is due to the fact it isn't MTL supported. Another words, the server can't
	have MTL running if it wishes to host CTF. This is a major problem as many/all servers now host MTL. If they don't, they
	soon update to it. It is in all, however, a cleverly made mod, and if a MTL version was created, would have a lot more
	popularity. <br />
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>ANNA</strong> <br> ANNA is a new gametype mod based on MTL and CRD aiming mostly at anticheats.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<br><strong>OpenDX</strong><br> OpenDX is an advanced gameplay mod aiming to add modern features and gametypes, while fixing
	many bugs and anticheats.<br>
</p>

## Replication
### What is it?
Replication, in basic terms, is the system in which information about the current server state is stored and distributed among the clients. 
If something happens on one client, its then "replicated" to the server, which syncs up with the other clients, to keep the state of the world persistant.

## Capturing the game
### Screenshots
<p>
	Screenshot or screen capture is is an image taken by the computer to record the visible items on the monitor <em>(source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot">Wikipedia article</a>)</em>.
</p>
<p>
	You may assign a button for taking screenshots in Deus Ex-&gt; Settings -&gt; Keyboard/Mouse. However the button doesn&#39;t
	work when the game ends, therefore if you want to take a screenshot of a scoreboard when the match ended, type a console
	command &quot;shot&quot; or &quot;sshot&quot; (in other words: press &quot;T&quot;, erase &quot;Say&quot; and type either
	&quot;shot&quot; or &quot;sshot&quot;).
</p>
<p>
	If you want to assign it to another button which is not available in Settings -&gt; Keyboard/Mouse window, you may
	<a href="kb/improvements/binding">bind it</a> in User.ini (as already mentioned, the command is &quot;shot&quot; or &quot;sshot&quot;).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The screenshot will appear in /System/ directory of your Deus Ex folder and the file name will look like Shot0001.bmp (Windows
	bitmap format). Note that Deus Ex has a limit of 255 screenshots. When you reach the limit, Deus Ex won&#39;t be making
	any more screenshots until you move the existing 255 screenshots to another place. You may put them to .zip or .rar archive
	to reduce disk space they use.
</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re willing to post a screenshot to the Internet, convert it to JPG or GIF format to reduce size (usually .bmp
	files are 10x times bigger than their .jpg analogues). There are hundreds of programs that could do that (e.g. Adobe Photoshop,
	Photopaint or even ACDSee) including a newer version of MS Paint which is included to every Windows version. In case with
	MS Paint, just open a screenshot and &quot;save it as&quot; .jpg file. Renaming the file in Windows won&#39;t change the
	format, but just a file name.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to make a screenshot without a HUD (user interface),&nbsp; type a console command:
</p>
```
	showhud false
```
<p>
	When you want to restore HUD, just go to the main menu and return back. Or instead you may type
</p>
```
	showhud true
```
<p>
	You may also experiment with FOV (angle of view). Type a console command <em>fov [value]</em>, e.g. <em>fov 95</em>. Default
	FOV is 85 (or 75 in older Deus Ex versions).
</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re willing to make something peculiar, try setting game speed to a lower value (if you&#39;re in multiplayer,
	you will need to be an admin + that will affect all the players on the server), e.g.: <em>slomo 0.5</em> (or if your
	server uses DXMTL, <em>admin slomo 0.5</em>). You will move slower and it will be easier to find a suitable location. Default
	game speed (<em>slomo</em>) value is 1.
</p>
<p>
	Making a screenshot from a different resolution is also very easy. Use a console command setres, e.g. <em>setres 1024x768</em>		(1024 is desired width, 768 is desired height). If your desired resolution is smaller than your normal resolution, your
	Deus Ex will have to expand to the new resolution. This will not affect the resolution of screenshots, but may be a bit
	unsuitable to play. If so, switch to the windowed mode (Alt + Enter or <em>togglefullscreen</em> command). For some unknown
	reason Deus Ex in windowed mode in <em>some</em> resolutions doesn&#39;t make screenshots properly (the image is distorted).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	You may also try a special program for making screenshots, instead of using a built in function. Pick a free program from
	<a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Shareware/Windows/Graphics/Screen_Capture/">this list</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Print screen button on your keyboard would also do that job, but after you press it you need to launch an image editor (e.g.
	MS Paint), paste it there and save somewhere.
</p>

###Demorec

#### What are demo recordings?
<p>
	Demo recording or so-called &quot;demorec&quot; is a recording of a game from 1st person view; to put it simply &mdash; a
	video of a game from eyes of the recorder. A demo recording done by a player in Deus Ex could be seen by other player who
	has Deus Ex and all the mods that were used during the recording (e.g., if it&#39;s a DXSG server, the viewer should have
	DXSG files and maps).
</p>
<p>
	A file with a demo recording (it has .dem extenstion and is located in DeusEx/System folder) contains only information about
	events that happened during the game, not the frames (pictures) themselves, and what a viewer sees is imitated by Deus
	Ex each time demo is played. Unlike video, you may enable a score board whenever you want, or type &quot;ping&quot; to
	see ping the recorder had, just like you would do in normal game. Demo recordings are usually hundred of times smaller
	than video files. An uncompressed video file in .avi format of 20 minutes of gameplay would take more than 2 GBs of diskspace,
	while a demorec would only need 6-9 MBs (depending on amount of players).
</p>
<p>
	Demo recordings are perfect way to learn how do others play the game and significantly improve one&#39;s skills. They are
	also used during the clanwars for later examination of strategies or just keeping track of scores, which may suddenly nullify
	due to technical problems. There are no ways to edit demo recordings yet, thus they may be used as an alibi for pleading
	not guilty in cheating.
</p>
<p>
	You will not be able to play or record demorecs if you didn&#39;t patch your Deus Ex beforehand. A patch is just a single
	file which you should place to your DeusEx/System folder (the patch is also called &quot;Engine.dll fix&quot;) &mdash;
	you may
	<a href="http://download.dxalpha.com/DX1/patches/engine-dll-fix.zip">download it here</a> (0.5 MB).
</p>
#### Where to get them from
<p>
	You may try downloading files from our
	<a href="http://download.dxalpha.com/index.php?dir=DX1%2Fmultiplayer%2Fdemorecs%2F">File Archive</a> or ask other players to send them to you. Many players do record their games from time to time, but rare
	ones share demos publicly (unlike&nbsp; for example, [3]Messiah, who&#39;s posted over 150 MBs of demorecs, which you may
	find in our Archive in folder named &quot;Messiah&quot; or
	<a href="http://www.triad.deusex-online.com/vb/showthread.php?t=2544">here</a>).&nbsp;
</p>
#### Viewing
<p>
	You have to patch your Deus Ex with &quot;Engine.dll fix&quot; (see link and description above) beforehand.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Place a demo recording, e.g., <em>myfirstdemorec.dem</em>, to <em>DeusEx/System</em> directory. </li>
	<li>Open Deus Ex. Press &quot;T&quot; and in the left bottom corner of your screen erase &quot;Say&quot;.</li>
	<li>Type (<em>myfirstdemorec</em> is an example &mdash; replace it with the name of your recording) <span class="code">demoplay myfirstdemorec<br />
</span></li>
	<li>To stop watching, type <span class="code">stopdemo</span></li>
</ol>
<p>
	Note:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If demo runs too fast, add <em>?timebased</em> to the demoplay command, i.e.:<br />
		<span class="code">demoplay myfirstdemorec?timebased</span></li>
	<li>As mentioned above, you will need all the files that were used on the server, e.g. maps, textures, etc; otherwise Deus
		Ex will crash.</li>
	<li>Some demo recordings are &quot;broken&quot; and they don&#39;t work at all &mdash; Deus Ex always crashes.</li>
	<li>Sometimes Deus Ex crashes a few times when starting playing a demo, but eventually it will play it (just try several times).</li>
	<li>Sometimes Deus Ex crashes when demos are played one after another. To avoid this, after stopping watching demo, go to &quot;Credits&quot;
		and return back. This helps in most cases, but not in all. </li>
	<li>You will watch it with ugly black translucent user interface. Unfortunately, there is no solution. If you want to exit
		game type either <em>stopdemo</em> and then go to the menu, or just type <em>exit</em>. </li>
	<li>Your screen will shiver when the person, who records it, crouches. No solution to this either.</li>
	<li> If the crosshair shiver, it doesn&#39;t mean that the person whom you watch, was shivering. It&#39;s just another unfixed
		problem.</li>
	<li>Augmentations like vision may not work correctly. E.g. vision may be enabled, but the viewer of a recording won&#39;t see
		anything and it may seem that the player aims at invisible opponents. <br />
	</li>
	<li>You will need to press &quot;Esc&quot; manually after a person was killed (to get rid of red message) and after hacking
		computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You may see a score board, use &quot;ping&quot;, &quot;stat net&quot;&nbsp; and other commands, just like in normal game.
	You will not see how the player types (just their messages) and you will not see<br />
</p>
#### Recording
<p>
	Recording is easier. While in game, type
</p>
<p class="code">
	demorec myfirstdemorec
</p>
<p>
	where <em>myfirstdemorec</em> is the name of your recording. To stop demo recording type:
</p>
<p class="code">
	demostop
</p>
<p>
	After recording you&#39;ll find a new file in your DeusEx/System folder.
</p>
<p>
	Note:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>When sharing it:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Don&#39;t forget to compress it into .zip or .rar archive.</li>
		<li>Don&#39;t forget to include (at least in a readme text file) what server it was played on and what mods/maps the recording
			requires.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t forget that its boring to watch a recording with active chat from your party :-)</li>
</ul>
