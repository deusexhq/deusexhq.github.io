<strong>Summary</strong>: Malkavian is a silly mod featuring remixed voice acting. There's little gameplay, but it's very
meme. If there was no insanity, it would be necessary to create it. -Catbag</p>

<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/hotel-carone">here</a> (https://www.moddb.com/mods/hotel-carone)<br>
<strong>Summary</strong>: An SP mission that lets you stay with UNATCO a little longer, an option many people, like myself,
have missed while playing Deus Ex. This is not a simple 'shoot'em all'-type mission, the player has to proceed with care.
Stealth is actually important, though probably not 100% necessary if you know what you have to do. ;) Especially in the
main map the player is not forced to move around in a certain way. The level design provides many possible paths and different
outcomes, the order for completing the objectives is not important, you can even fail some of them.<br> 29 MB download,
a couple of hours playtime. Have fun. :)</p>

<strong>Summary</strong>: You take on the role of Peter Kent: gallant gamer, put-upon party-goer, ersatz errand boy, suburban
swashbuckler.<br> Navigate a middle-class morass of whiny girlfriends, surly cops, slippery coworkers, surly bartenders,
surly bosses, and more.<br> Your mission: procure an ever-growing list of supplies to ensure an appropriately inappropriate
weekend of drinking, revelry, and what have you.</p>

<strong>Summary</strong>: 2027 is a modification and a prequel to Deus Ex. New stunning DirectX 9 based graphics.<br> The
story is flexible, nonlinear, and allows much wider exploration than before. The final outcone depends entirely on you and
your actions. The solutions to any challenge depend only on your imagination.<br> Lots of new weapons and equipment. You

ways.<br> New skills, perks and augmentations have been added.<br> A player will be able to use portable spider bots, which
he can control and use for exploring a territory and attack. It is also possible to repair and recharge these bots.<br> Weather effects, ranging from a light drizzle to thunderstorms and snowfall.<br> Almost all the locations are based on real
photos and maps, and the levels in 2027 will be wider than in the original game.<br> Many cutscenes and intros give a real
atmosphere to the rich storyline.<br> New high quality fonts with anti-aliasing.<br> A lot of bugs from the original game
have been fixed.<br></p>

<strong>Summary</strong>: "Removing the suck from Deus Ex." It's an odd slogan, but that's what Shifter does, what little
of it there is. In my opinion anyway. A little mod that started off as an effort to get the damn laser sight to turn on
automatically now includes additional augmentations, unique weapons, new game mechanics, bugfixes, restored game content,
and even a complete and working alt-fire option for almost every weapon. All of this, seamlessly integrated into the existing
game, capable of running simultaneously with almost any other Deus Ex mod. Play your favorite mod, then play it again, "Shifter-ized".<br>  BioMod is an extension of Y|yukichigai's excellent Shifter mod for Deus Ex. While I still think Shifter is a definite improvement
over the original game, I sometimes felt while playing it that it was too conservative for my tastes. Eventually I decided
to make my own mod which would contain some radical changes that might give some people pause, but would hopefully breathe
new life into the game for everyone else.<br> As the name suggests, BioMod is primarily concerned with Deus Ex's augmentations,
with the aim of making them more balanced, but also a lot easier to manage. Most augs are now automated, using energy only
when they're actually doing their jobs. Some augs that were less useful or that would be a pain to manage have been made
free or given extra abilities, while those that I thought were un-salvageable have been replaced with entirely new augs.
In addition to the augmentation system, BioMod also makes some general gameplay changes, such as the addition of pickpocketing,
an autosave feature, achievement-like challenges, and a Thief style ledge grabbing system. </p>
